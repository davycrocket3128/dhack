# Contributing to The Peacenet

Contributing to The Peacenet is not hard.  All we ask is that, when writing or discussing

 - issues
 - pull requests
 - commits

we ask that you do not, **under any circumstances**, discuss topics related to putting out the flame on a Charmander.

Do not make a birthday wish on a Charmander's tail.  _It's just not cool._
