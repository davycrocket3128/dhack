The Peacenet is a hacking game that uses the Unreal Engine. 
The game features a procedurally generated world, a unique storyline, 
realistic hacking mechanics, and more.

### License

As of December 7th, 2018, The Peacenet has gone proprietary. The game itself is proprietary, however some components of the game such as its terminal emulator, mission system, window manager and other components are free and open-source. Those components are licensed under the **MIT license.**

This game also uses **Unreal technology**, which is a registered trademark of Epic Games, Inc. See [`UE-LICENSE`](UE-LICENSE) for info.

### Fun fact:

This game does not use Contemporary Typeface throughout the UI. THat font is the literal opposite of a hacker font.
